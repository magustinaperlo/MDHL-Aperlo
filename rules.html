                     team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
                     this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey 
                     background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                                whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
                                from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
